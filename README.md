# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to retrieve a user by ID. However, it fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid integer, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling to address these issues.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Send a request to `/users/abc` (or any non-numeric ID).  The server will likely crash or return an unexpected result. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation and error handling to prevent crashes and provide informative error messages to the client.
